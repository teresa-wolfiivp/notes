- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' — Leonardo da Vinci. Always strive to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Remember that code is read far more often than it is written. Optimize for clarity and understandability, as this will save time and reduce errors in the long run. Modularize your code, use descriptive names, and embrace the power of abstraction. And never underestimate the value of good documentation." 

"In addition, 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil.' — Donald Knuth. Focus on writing correct code first, then optimize if and where necessary. With today's powerful hardware, many times well-structured code can perform sufficiently without micro-optimizations. Profile your application to identify actual bottlenecks rather than guessing where performance improvements might be needed."

In practice, this means:
1. Write clear, concise functions and methods.
2. Use descriptive variable names.
3. Practice good modularity and separation of concerns.
4. Optimize for readability and clarity before prematurely optimizing for performance.
5. Test your code thoroughly to ensure its correctness, which also aids in understanding its purpose and behavior.
